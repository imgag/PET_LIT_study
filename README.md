## Figures

The figures folder contains the image file, its source data and the script to generate the supplementary figure 1-3 
and 8. The data is stored in each sub-folder and named accordingly. The other figures can be generated with the 
`run_analysis.py` script in the `Scripts` folder. 

## cfDNA Panels

The folder `cfDNA Panels` contains the monitoring variants for each patient which were enriched during sequencing. 
Additionally, 90 variant sites were enriched for patient identification and quality control. These are defined in the 
file `Targets_for_Sample_Identification.bed`.
